# Bjerk's Typescript boilerplate

This repository contains a basic Typescript boilerplate, based on Bjerk's
typical setup.

```shell
yarn create bjerk-typescript my-app
```

Check the [package.json] for more details.

## Motivation

There are thousands of boilerplates on GitHub, and being a company that both
contributes and loves Open Source it makes sense to use them. However, we
haven't found a boilerplate that follows the guidelines below.

#### 1. Keep it barebone, but enough to provide value

The required tools should come with the boilerplate. An example is Fastify, even
though we use Fastify for most of our projects, we don't use Fastify for all the
applications. This boilerplate should be barebone for 95% of our projects.

Another example is Jest; Node 18 includes a test runner â€“ do we need it anymore?
We should keep asking ourselves that question to make the best boilerplate.

#### 2. Continuous attention to technical excellence

Having a great starting point is paramount. Our boilerplate should strive to
always improve technical excellence/quality.

#### 3. Keep it up-to-date

Things change in the software industry very quickly. Our boilerplate should
always be kept maintained. We want to start from the most up-to-date point, it
feels weird to start updating packages when you start from a boilerplate.

#### A boilerplate to be inspired by

We strive to make this boilerplate a single source of truth for code that is
up-to-date and of upmost technical excellence.
